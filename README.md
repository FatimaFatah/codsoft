These are my C++ initial and simple projects:
1.NUMBER_GUESSING GAME : In this firstly you have to input your name then the system will generate a random number between 1-100 and ask you to guess that number when you input a number it will tell you whether you have guessed the correct number or you are nearer to correct number means your guessed number is greater or less than the actual number.
2.SIMPLE_CALCULATOR:   In this firstly it will ask from you that how many operators calculation do you want to perform 1 or 2 if you press 1 it will ask you to input 2 operands and 1 operator and will calulate that but if you press 2 it will ask you to input 3 operands and 2 operators and will calulate that.
3.TIK_TAK_TOE_GAME: In this you will play a game like there will be 2 players X and Y turn by turn you will input a number from 1 to 8 and there are 8 conditions on which you can won the game if X will fulfill any condition it will how you that congrats X has won if  Y will fulfill any condition it will how you that congrats Y has won but if both will not meet that condition it will show GAME DRAW.
